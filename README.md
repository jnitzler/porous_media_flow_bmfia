# Isotropic Darcy flow
This is a fully parallelized implementation of a darcy flow PDE with a transverse isotropic permeability field, using deal.ii. The governing equations that are solved read as follows:

```math
\begin{align*}
K^{-1}\boldsymbol{u} + \nabla p&=0 \text{ in } \Omega\\
-\text{div} \boldsymbol{u} &= f \text{ in } \Omega\\
p &= g \text{ on } \delta\Omega
\end{align*}
```

With $`K`$ being a $`\dim\times\dim`$ permeability tensor, $`\boldsymbol{u}`$ the flow velocity and $`p`$ the pressure.
We implemented a transverse isotropic permeability field $`K(\boldsymbol{x})`$, which is modeled by random fields, parameterized by a set of coefficients $`\boldsymbol{x}`$.

The project builds two executables:
-  1) darcy.cc $`\rightarrow`$ darcy: The actual main executable and forward solve of the pde for a specific choice of random field coefficients $`\boldsymbol{x}`$ which imposes the mapping: $`\boldsymbol{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x})`$
-  2) darcy_adjoint.cc $`\rightarrow`$ darcy_adjoint: The associated adjoint problem that returns the derivative $`\frac{\partial g(f(\boldsymbol{x}))}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}`$ for an objective function $`g`$

## Random permeability field
The random isotropic permeability tensor $`K(\boldsymbol{x})`$ is modeled as follows:
$`K(\boldsymbol{x})=\exp(\boldsymbol{x})\cdot I`$,

such that $`\boldsymbol{x}`$ can be inferred without constraints.
## Running the executables
The executables require
- a path to an input file
- a path to the output directory
- the adjoint executable requires additionally a file `adjoint_data.npy` which has to be located in the same directory as the input file.

The primary problem can be started with `mpirun -np <num_procs> darcy <path/to/test_input.npy> <path/to/output_dir>`. The associated adjoint problem with analogous with `mpirun -np <num_procs> darcy_adjoint <path/to/test_input.npy> <path/to/output_dir>`

## Setup, installation and dependencies
This code requires the installation and setup of [deal.ii](https://www.dealii.org/), furthermore, the [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) project needs to be configured and installed. For parallel computing, respectively partitioning we furthermore require the installation of 
[p4est](pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/gallery.html). The implementation of the [random fields is a separate project](https://gitlab.lrz.de/adjoint_problems/random_fields) that needs to be downloaded. The import path for the respective header file might need to be adjusted in the source code.
## Associated deal.ii tutorials
The code is inspired by the deal.ii [tutorial 20](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_20.html) for the overall idea, [tutorials 21](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_21.html) and [22](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_22.html) for handling block systems and further enhanced solution strategies. We furthermore used [tutorial 43](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_43.html) for improved solvers and an efficient block-preconditioner. Finally, [tutorials 31](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_31.html) and [32](https://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.II/step_32.html) were used to parallelize the code for use on multiple processors.
